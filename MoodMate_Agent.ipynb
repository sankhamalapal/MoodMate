            "\n",
            "**User's Wellness State:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The user is currently experiencing a significantly low mood (2/10), very high stress levels (9/10), and poor sleep quality (2/10). They are also reporting low energy and headaches, suggesting physical strain. The user's difficulty in pinpointing specific worries indicates they may be feeling overwhelmed or generally unwell, making it hard to articulate individual concerns. Overall, the user is in a state of distress, with multiple indicators pointing to significant emotional and physical discomfort.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Personalized Action Plan:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the user's current state, the focus needs to be on immediate relief, gentle self-care, and building towards stability.\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Acknowledge and Validate:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Start each day by taking a deep breath and silently acknowledging how you feel without judgment. Remind yourself that it's okay to not be okay.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** This helps to create a foundation of self-compassion, which is crucial when feeling overwhelmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Gentle Movement & Body Scan:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Aim for 5-10 minutes of very gentle movement. This could be light stretching, a slow walk around the house, or even just wiggling your toes and fingers. After moving, do a quick \"body scan\" from head to toe, noticing any sensations without trying to change them.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Physical activity, even minimal, can help release tension and improve circulation. A body scan can help increase awareness of physical symptoms and potentially identify areas of tension related to stress.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Mindful Breathing & Sensory Focus:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Throughout the day, when you notice your stress or headaches increasing, take 3 slow, deep breaths. As you exhale, imagine some of the tension leaving your body. Additionally, engage one of your senses mindfully for 1-2 minutes – focus on the taste of water, the feeling of a soft blanket, the sound of gentle music, or the sight of something calming.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** This provides immediate, accessible tools for managing acute stress and anxiety. Engaging the senses can be grounding and pull you out of a cycle of worry.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene (Even if Sleep is Poor):**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Even if sleep quality is low, try to maintain a consistent bedtime and wake-up time. Make your bedroom as dark, quiet, and cool as possible. Avoid screens for at least 30-60 minutes before bed. If you can't sleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet, relaxing activity in dim light until you feel sleepy.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Consistency is key for regulating the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, even when sleep is currently difficult. Creating a conducive sleep environment removes potential obstacles.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Hydration & Nutrition Check:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Ensure you're drinking enough water throughout the day. Try to have at least one small, balanced meal or snack that includes some protein and fiber.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Dehydration and poor nutrition can exacerbate fatigue and headaches. Simple, easily digestible options are best when energy is low.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Small Win of the Day:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Identify one very small, achievable task you can accomplish today. This could be making your bed, sending one email, or watering a plant. Focus on the feeling of accomplishment once it's done.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** When feeling low and overwhelmed, small successes can help rebuild a sense of efficacy and control.\n",
            "\n",
            "7.  **Consider Professional Support:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** If these feelings persist or worsen, please consider reaching out to a mental health professional, doctor, or a trusted support person.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** While this plan offers immediate strategies, professional guidance is invaluable for addressing underlying issues and developing comprehensive coping mechanisms.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Plan Quality Evaluation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The plan is designed to be **high quality** for the immediate situation because it is:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Empathetic & Gentle:** It starts with validation and focuses on very small, manageable steps. This is crucial given the user's low mood, high stress, and low energy.\n",
            "*   **Actionable:** The steps are concrete and can be implemented immediately, even with limited energy.\n",
            "*   **Holistic:** It addresses mood, stress, sleep, physical symptoms (headaches, tension), energy, and the difficulty in identifying specific worries.\n",
            "*   **Progressive:** It builds from immediate coping strategies to longer-term sleep hygiene and the recommendation for professional support.\n",
            "*   **Non-Pressuring:** The emphasis is on \"aim for,\" \"try to,\" and \"even,\" which reduces the likelihood of the user feeling like a failure if they can't complete a step perfectly.\n",
            "\n",
            "The plan prioritizes creating small moments of relief and building a foundation of self-care without demanding too much from the user. It directly responds to the user's reported symptoms and current state.\n",

            "2.  **Sleep Improvement:** Addressing sleep quality is vital for recovery, as it impacts mood, energy, and stress resilience.\n",
            "3.  **Mood Elevation:** Your current mood (2/10) requires gentle strategies to begin shifting towards a more stable state.\n",

Please know that it's completely understandable to feel drained and to experience physical symptoms like headaches when you're under so much strain. I'm here to help you find ways to navigate this challenging time.\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **Acknowledge & Breathe (Immediate - Morning & Throughout Day):**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Start your day by taking 3 slow, deep breaths. As you exhale, consciously release some of the tension you're holding. When you feel overwhelmed, pause and take these deep breaths again.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** This is a simple, immediate way to activate your body's relaxation response and can help to slightly lower your stress in the moment.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Soothe the Headaches & Tension (As Needed):**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Try a warm compress or a cool cloth on your forehead or the back of your neck. Gently massage your temples or the base of your skull if it feels comfortable. Stay hydrated by sipping water.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** These are non-strenuous methods to directly address your headache symptoms and can provide some physical relief, which may indirectly help your mood and stress.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Prioritize Rest (Even if Sleep is Poor):**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Aim to go to bed and wake up around the same time, even if you don't sleep well. Create a calm, dark, and quiet environment. If you're wide awake in bed for more than 20 minutes, get up, do a quiet, non-stimulating activity in dim light (like reading a book or listening to calm music), and return to bed when you feel sleepy.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Consistency helps regulate your body clock. While quality is low now, establishing a routine is the first step to improving sleep over time and signals to your body that it's time to rest.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Gentle Sensory Engagement (Throughout Day):**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Choose one comforting sensory experience for 2-5 minutes. This could be listening to calming music, smelling a pleasant scent (like lavender), holding a soft object, or mindfully savoring a warm drink.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Engaging your senses in a positive way can help interrupt anxious thought patterns and provide a brief, grounding distraction from distress.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Small, Achievable \"Win\" (Once Today):**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Identify ONE very small task you can accomplish, like drinking a glass of water, opening a window for fresh air, or brushing your teeth. Focus on the feeling of having completed it.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** When everything feels overwhelming, accomplishing even the smallest task can provide a tiny sense of control and a momentary boost.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Seek Support (Consider Today/Tomorrow):**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Please consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health professional. Since your score is critical, professional support is highly recommended.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** You don't have to go through this alone. Talking to someone can provide immediate comfort and a path towards understanding and managing these intense feelings and symptoms.\n",

For example, \"As you practice deep breathing, notice if any specific thoughts or feelings surface, even fleetingly. No need to analyze, just observe.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "**User's Wellness State:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The user is currently experiencing a significantly low mood (2/10), very high stress levels (9/10), and poor sleep quality (2/10). They are also reporting low energy and headaches, suggesting physical strain. The user's difficulty in pinpointing specific worries indicates they may be feeling overwhelmed or generally unwell, making it hard to articulate individual concerns. Overall, the user is in a state of distress, with multiple indicators pointing to significant emotional and physical discomfort.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Personalized Action Plan:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the user's current state, the focus needs to be on immediate relief, gentle self-care, and building towards stability.\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Acknowledge and Validate:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Start each day by taking a deep breath and silently acknowledging how you feel without judgment. Remind yourself that it's okay to not be okay.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** This helps to create a foundation of self-compassion, which is crucial when feeling overwhelmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Gentle Movement & Body Scan:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Aim for 5-10 minutes of very gentle movement. This could be light stretching, a slow walk around the house, or even just wiggling your toes and fingers. After moving, do a quick \"body scan\" from head to toe, noticing any sensations without trying to change them.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Physical activity, even minimal, can help release tension and improve circulation. A body scan can help increase awareness of physical symptoms and potentially identify areas of tension related to stress.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Mindful Breathing & Sensory Focus:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Throughout the day, when you notice your stress or headaches increasing, take 3 slow, deep breaths. As you exhale, imagine some of the tension leaving your body. Additionally, engage one of your senses mindfully for 1-2 minutes – focus on the taste of water, the feeling of a soft blanket, the sound of gentle music, or the sight of something calming.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** This provides immediate, accessible tools for managing acute stress and anxiety. Engaging the senses can be grounding and pull you out of a cycle of worry.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene (Even if Sleep is Poor):**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Even if sleep quality is low, try to maintain a consistent bedtime and wake-up time. Make your bedroom as dark, quiet, and cool as possible. Avoid screens for at least 30-60 minutes before bed. If you can't sleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet, relaxing activity in dim light until you feel sleepy.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Consistency is key for regulating the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, even when sleep is currently difficult. Creating a conducive sleep environment removes potential obstacles.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Hydration & Nutrition Check:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Ensure you're drinking enough water throughout the day. Try to have at least one small, balanced meal or snack that includes some protein and fiber.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Dehydration and poor nutrition can exacerbate fatigue and headaches. Simple, easily digestible options are best when energy is low.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Small Win of the Day:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** Identify one very small, achievable task you can accomplish today. This could be making your bed, sending one email, or watering a plant. Focus on the feeling of accomplishment once it's done.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** When feeling low and overwhelmed, small successes can help rebuild a sense of efficacy and control.\n",
            "\n",
            "7.  **Consider Professional Support:**\n",
            "    *   **Action:** If these feelings persist or worsen, please consider reaching out to a mental health professional, doctor, or a trusted support person.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** While this plan offers immediate strategies, professional guidance is invaluable for addressing underlying issues and developing comprehensive coping mechanisms.\n",

            "**Plan Quality Evaluation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The plan is designed to be **high quality** for the immediate situation because it is:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Empathetic & Gentle:** It starts with validation and focuses on very small, manageable steps. This is crucial given the user's low mood, high stress, and low energy.\n",
            "*   **Actionable:** The steps are concrete and can be implemented immediately, even with limited energy.\n",
            "*   **Holistic:** It addresses mood, stress, sleep, physical symptoms (headaches, tension), energy, and the difficulty in identifying specific worries.\n",
            "*   **Progressive:** It builds from immediate coping strategies to longer-term sleep hygiene and the recommendation for professional support.\n",
            "*   **Non-Pressuring:** The emphasis is on \"aim for,\" \"try to,\" and \"even,\" which reduces the likelihood of the user feeling like a failure if they can't complete a step perfectly.\n",
            "\n",
            "The plan prioritizes creating small moments of relief and building a foundation of self-care without demanding too much from the user. It directly responds to the user's reported symptoms and current state.\n",
