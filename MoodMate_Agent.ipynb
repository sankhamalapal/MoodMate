            "2.  **Refine \"Quick Mood Booster\":** While listening to music is good, it could be made slightly more actionable. Suggesting a specific *type* of uplifting music (e.g., \"music that evokes happy memories\") or pairing it with a very brief physical action (like dancing or stretching) might enhance its impact.\n",
