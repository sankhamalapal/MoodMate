            "\n",
            "**Coverage:** 80/100 - The plan addresses the main stressors (work, sleep, anxiety, isolation) and physical symptoms (headaches, muscle tension, difficulty concentrating) identified. However, it could more explicitly link actions to the performance review anxiety beyond general stress management.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Feasibility:** 95/100 - Most actions are short (<20 minutes) and realistic, with a good mix of \"do today\" and \"this week\" tasks. The breathing exercises, quick mood boost, and sleep hygiene tips are particularly feasible for immediate implementation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Evidence-Based:** 90/100 - The recommendations for breathing exercises, Vitamin D3, Magnesium, sleep hygiene, movement, and social connection are all well-supported by scientific research for stress, mood, and sleep improvement.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Personalization:** 85/100 - The plan is well-tailored to the user's stated mood, stress, sleep, energy, and physical symptoms. The specific vitamin recommendations and sleep hygiene tips are directly linked to the user's current state. It could be slightly more personalized by acknowledging the specific anxiety around the \"performance review\" with a targeted strategy.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Balance:** 90/100 - There's a good balance between immediate relief actions (breathing exercises, mood boost) and building long-term habits (social connection, movement, consistent sleep hygiene, journaling).\n",
            "\n",
            "**Overall Quality Score:** 88/100 (B)\n",
            "\n",
            "**Specific Improvements Needed:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Target Performance Review Anxiety:** While general stress management is included, consider adding a specific action to address the anxiety related to the upcoming performance review, such as practicing talking points, visualizing a positive outcome, or doing a quick 'fear-setting' exercise.\n",
            "2.  **Connect Physical Symptoms to Actions:** While Magnesium is suggested for muscle tension, consider adding a gentle stretching routine for shoulders and neck or recommending a short self-massage technique as part of the daily movement, given the user's reported muscle tension and headaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Strengths of the Plan:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Clear Prioritization:** The \"HIGH PRIORITY: Immediate Actions\" section is excellent for guiding immediate steps.\n",
            "*   **Actionable & Specific:** The plan provides concrete, easy-to-follow instructions for each action.\n",
            "*   **Holistic Approach:** It effectively integrates physical, mental, and social well-being strategies.\n",
            "*   **Resource Provision:** Including links to mental health resources is a valuable addition.\n",
            "*   **Encouraging Tone:** The plan maintains a supportive and empathetic tone throughout.\n",
