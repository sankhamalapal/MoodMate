            "1.  **Mindful Moment (5 minutes):** When you feel your stress levels rising, try a quick mindfulness exercise. You can find many guided meditations for stress relief on apps like Calm or Headspace, or simply focus on your breath for a few minutes.\n",
            "    *   **Goal:** To bring a sense of calm and reduce immediate stress.\n",
            "2.  **Gentle Movement (15-20 minutes):** Since you're experiencing fatigue, start with something light. A short walk outdoors, some gentle stretching, or even just moving around your home can help boost energy levels without being too demanding.\n",
            "    *   **Goal:** To combat fatigue and improve energy gradually.\n",
            "3.  **Comforting Routine (Evening):** Focus on creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine. This could include a warm bath, reading a light book, listening to calming music, or journaling for a few minutes about things you are grateful for (even small things).\n",
            "    *   **Goal:** To improve sleep quality.\n",
            "4.  **Self-Compassion Practice:** Acknowledge that it's okay to not feel your best and that you're doing your best. When you notice difficult thoughts or feelings, try saying to yourself, \"This is a moment of suffering. Suffering is a part of life. May I be kind to myself in this moment.\"\n",
            "    *   **Goal:** To foster a kinder, more supportive internal dialogue.\n",
            "5.  **Hydration and Nutrition:** Ensure you're drinking enough water throughout the day and try to have at least one nourishing meal. Sometimes, our physical well-being can be a foundation for our mental state.\n",
            "    *   **Goal:** To support physical energy and overall health.\n",

            "*   **Holistic Approach:** The plan incorporates elements for immediate stress relief, energy boosting, sleep improvement, and self-care.\n",

            "**Potential Improvement:** While the plan is good, if the user were to express more specific stressors, even vaguely, future plans could incorporate strategies for addressing those specific issues (e.g., time management for work stress, communication strategies for relationship stress).
